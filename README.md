Oi you! Do you like a weapon packs that are way too big? Do you enjoy a bills tab so unreasonably large a scrollbar may be required to explore it? Do you like to have large amounts of variants on weapons because that one weapons pack you usually use just doesn't have the specific MP5 you want? Well have I got the mod for you.

Introducing Rambo Weapons Pack, containing a fuckhuge amount of weapons from real life. That's it. It just adds a lot of guns.

**Compatibility**
This mod modifies vanilla weapons. In the case you have another mod that modifies or removes vanilla weapons, you're going to come across some compatibility issues.

This version RWP IS compatible and intended to be used with CE, lets face it if you wanted this many gun variations you were already using CE. 

**Plans for the future:**
