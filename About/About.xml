Current Version: 1.2.3

Oi you! Do you like a weapon packs that are way too big? Do you enjoy a bills tab so unreasonably large a scrollbar may be required to explore it? Do you like to have large amounts of variants on weapons because that one weapons pack you usually use just doesn&apos;t have the specific MP5 you want? Well have I got the mod for you.

Introducing Rambo Weapons Pack, containing a fuckhuge amount of weapons from real life. That&apos;s it. It just adds a lot of guns.

[b]Compatibility[/b]
This mod modifies vanilla weapons. In the case you have another mod that modifies or removes vanilla weapons, you&apos;re going to come across some compatibility issues.
RWP IS compatible with CE. The CE version can be found [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1236635699]here[/url], along with older versions in the ludeon forums thread if you&apos;re running A17.

[b]Plans for the future:[/b]
Explodey guns update
More guns

[b]Feedback[/b]
The most important thing I currently need is feedback. Things like balance, if certain guns are overpowered or underpowered. Obviously some guns will always be better than others, but if a certain gun seems to dominates their stage in the game that&apos;s a clear sign of imbalance. An example would be if all other mid-tier guns are ignored over AK&apos;s, simply because they&apos;re cheap to produce. I may tend to do this, but that&apos;s my playstyle. I need feedback from other users to get a general sense if this is actually universal or just me.
Ofcourse, suggestions for new guns and all that is appreciated as well. It&apos;s always nice to have some attention.
You can post all feedback either on the Ludeon Forums thread or on the RWP discord.
